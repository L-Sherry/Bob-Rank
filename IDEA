should probably patch drawLayers
to draw on webgl instead.

should check if discarding things in the fragment shader does affect zindex or not, if it does, then we have
to optimise as follow:
- find out everything without transparent pixelz
- draw them from top to bottom, with face culling enableded
- disable face culling
- draw all the things with transparent pixelz

there is a wallY attribute that should probably be used for entities.
