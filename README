Bob is a daemonic creature that falls from the sky to stomp people that pirate
videogames.

CrossCode included.



About this:

This is an unfinished CrossCode mod that does very special things when achieving
S-Rank.  But right now, it does not work.  Which is why the special things are
enabled unconditionally.

So this is only useful for CrossCode modders that want to have fun developping
or fixing it.
